### About the project attached to this repository
This is the bare project as shown on the class of 14 February at Saxion Deventer. 

#### Important changes
In this project, the 'Assign Player Controls' script has been updated, which means it now works well with HMDs when 'Build Settings' are set to 'Android'.
What it fixes: the controller implemented for PC only is bypassed when it recognises a VR headset that uses the XR package.

NOTE: this was not tested with 'Build Settings' set to 'Windows' or another setting.

#### How to get
To get this project, either:
- Click on 'Code' and download a zip
or
- Download via your terminal to a folder using "Git Clone [address of repo]" if you have Git installed.
